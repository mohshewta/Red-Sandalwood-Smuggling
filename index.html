      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Red sandalwood smuggling has become a major concern in India and across international borders. This rare wood, known for its deep red hue and medicinal properties, is illegally harvested and traded despite strict regulations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="reasons">
      <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Why does it happen?
      <p>High demand from foreign markets, especially in East Asia, drives smuggling. Red sandalwood fetches astronomical prices due to its use in musical instruments, luxury furniture, and traditional medicine.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="impact">
      <h2 style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Impact of Smuggling</h2>
      <p>Smuggling causes massive deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and threatens the survival of this valuable tree species. Law enforcement faces immense challenges tackling these organized crime networks.
